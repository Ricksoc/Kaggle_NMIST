# Kaggle_NMIST
Submission to Kaggle NMIST digit recognition competition
This was my first attempt at a Kaggle dataset. I experimented with pca, scaling and hyperparameter tuning o Random Forest and kNN. 
I found that kNN had the best accuracy but that after hyperparameter tuning the model was unworkably slow unless  reduced the amount 
of training data I fed it to the point where the model performed worse than the untuned version.
